# Day One: Home Page

## Instructions

The first page you will create for your fan site is the home page and will have the following elements:

* There should be a navigation bar at the top of the page that lists at least three links. These links should be something along these lines:
    * Home
    * Favorites/Featured - A specfic work/topic/character/etc you want to dedicated a page to
    * List of items - A page that lists the various works/episodes/books/etc
    * A form - This will generally be a contact page, but if you have a clever use for a form on your site, you are free to use it.

This navbar will be present on every page.

* A hook
    * Your site should have some eye-catching element (i.e. a Jumbotron) that draws the user in and encourages them to stay on your page
    * Plain text works, but an image will probably be more effective

* A brief description/bio of the subject of the site

* Leadins for the other pages

* A footer with basic copyright information

## Challenge

If you are looking for a little extra challenge, consider adding the following to your site:

* Have your hook cycle through 3 or more images

* Add a button for the breif description element that, when clicked, opens a popup (modal) that has a longer description
