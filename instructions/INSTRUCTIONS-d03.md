# Day Three: List Page

## Instructions

For this day, you will create a page that list the items in a visually appealing way. Think of this as a discogrphy for a musician/band, episodes in a season for a television, or the main characters from a book.

The page should have the following elements:

* The Navbar

* The list of item, which should include:
    * Name of the work
    * A short description of the item
    * A visual element (picture of character, album cover, etc.)

* The Footer

## Challenge

If this was too easy for you, try adding this:

* If there are a lot of items of the page:
    * Separate the list onto mulitple pages
    * Use pagnation to the pages so users can quickly switch between pages

* Add a popup element for each item that has more information about that item
    * For example, click on the charcter card opens a modal that has a complete bio for the character

* Add a multimedia element to the item listing
    * I.E. Youtube link to favorite scene for a character or the song
