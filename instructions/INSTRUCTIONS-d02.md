# Day Two: List page

## Instructions

* The featured content, which should include:
    * An Image
    * A few paragraphs
    * "Fun Facts" section

* The footer (the same one you created for the homepage)

## Challenge

If you are up to a challenge, try adding these elements to your page:
    
* Add some design to your content, this may include:
    * Blockquote
    * Background image
    * Emphasis on important text

* Create "Past" Featured Content Pages and have "Next" and "Back" links to those pages
